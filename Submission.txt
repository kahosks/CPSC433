CPSC 433 
Assignment Final Submission

To Run Program:

•	Compile Java program in desired directory

For all weights to be 1 and penalties to have default values 0 and 1 respectively, type in command line:
•	java Scheduler –f <filename> 

For weights to be given non-default values, type in command line:

•	java Scheduler –f <filename> -mc <min course weight> <min course/lab penalty> -ml <min lab weight> -pr <preferences> -pa <pair> <pair_penalty> -s <secdiff> <secdiff_penalty>


Errors Solved after Demo:

1) parallel_pen: 

Class: SoftConstraints.java
Method: getPair(int[] time)
Problem: The ints aTime and bTime were instantiated inside the inner for loop, causing the values to be     written over every loop, giving the wrong Eval-value.  Both aTime and bTime were moved outside that for loop, which solved the problem.

2) pen_secdiff:

Class: SoftConstraints.java
Method: getSecDiff(int[] time)
Problem: Fixed the values in the substring call on lines 185, 188, 191, and 193. Changed x=0 to x=2 on line 183 to skip over the depth and Eval values in the array.  Cleaned up the logic in the method and removed redundancy in if-statement checks.
