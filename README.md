# CPSC433
CPSC433 And Tree Implementation

So this only isn't exactly needed, as no ReadMe file is required for the final project, but would be another way to colloborate on the status of the project, used in conjunction with the commit lists.

CPSC 433 Checklist - Feel free to add to it!

    Hard Constraints:
-All constraints implemented

-All constraints work with heap

-Able to discard solutions that do not work

    Soft constraints:

-All constraints have classes

-All constraints implemented properly

-Constraints give eval-value after checking solution

-Works with heap

    Heap:

-Adds potential solutions

-Filters potential solutions properly

-Is updated constantly (solutions added/deleted accordingly)

-Returns a best solution

    While loop for heap:

-Add solutions to heap

-Deletes some solutions that are not valid as to prevent heap from becoming too large (filters via hard constraints)/EVAL value

-Adds solutions that pass hard constraints into heap

-Keeps going until all possible solutions found (heap is empty)

    Parser:

-Parses file properly

-Able to put data into appropriate structures

    Output:

-TODO: Make sure there is a class/method that outputs the final solution.  The courses are to be printed to console in alphabetical order (can use String.compareTo() or equivalent) DONE!
